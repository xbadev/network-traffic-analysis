# Network Traffic Analysis Lab

Hands-on network traffic analysis using Wireshark in a virtualized lab environment. Each section captures, filters, and analyzes different types of network traffic to understand how protocols behave on the wire and why encryption matters.

## Labs

| # | Lab | Description |
|---|-----|-------------|
| 1 | [Telnet vs SSH](telnet-vs-ssh/) | Captured and compared cleartext Telnet traffic against encrypted SSH traffic. Demonstrated full credential exposure over Telnet using Wireshark TCP stream analysis. |
